# Forecasting the Remaining Duration of an Ongoing Solar Flare

This repository contains the data and routines to accompany the paper Reep & Barnes 2021, submitted to Space Weather.  The model uses a random forest regression method to forecast the remaining duration of a solar flare as measured by GOES/XRS data.  

The code uses the following packages: Numpy, matplotlib, Scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and SunPy.
